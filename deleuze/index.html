						<h1>Biographical Notes</h1>
						<p class="fragment">Drawn from our good friends Vincent Leitch et al., Brian Massumi's translator's foreword to <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>, and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/">the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</a></p>

						<h3>Gilles Deleuze</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>“What got me by during that period was conceiving of the history of philosophy as a kind of ass-fuck, or, what amounts to the same thing, an immaculate conception. I imagined myself approaching an author from behind and giving him a child that would indeed be his but would nonetheless be monstrous.”—Gilles Deleuze</p>

						<h2>Pragmatics</h2>
						<p class="fragment">“[American authors] know how to move between things, establish the logic of AND, overthrow ontology, do away with foundations, nullify endings and beginnings. They know how to practice pragmatics” (1462).</p>

						<h2>Energies in Lines of Flight</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Material in/as affective energies</h3>
						<p class="fragment"><small>NB: Affect (as a term) “[does not] denote a personal feeling . . . [it's] the ability to affect and be affected. It is a prepersonal intensity corresponding to the passage from one experiential sate of the body to another and implying an augmentation or dimunition in that body's capacity to act” (Massumi, xvi).</small></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Physical material and psychic interiority</h3>
						<p class="fragment"><small>“The mode of produciton of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciosuness of men that determins their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness” (Marx/Engels, <em>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</em>, 662–63).</small></p>
						<p class="fragment"><small>“What is important is not whether the flows are ‘One or multiple’—we're past that point: there is a collective assembalge of enunciation, a machine assemblage of desire, one inside the other and both plugged into an immense outside that is a multiplicity in any case” (D/G, <em>ATP</em>, 1460–61).</small></p>

					<section>
						<h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
						<p class="fragment"><small>1. D/G offer a small argument at the end of this chapter for how literature can model and perform rhizomatic movement, and their entire project in ATP is to effect a rhizome in their writing. <b style="color: yellow;">What are some (theoretical or literary) strategies through which they attempt to create a rhizome here? How effective do you find these strategies?</b> In light of conversation around materia, <b style="color: yellow;">what are the stakes of using writing as the medium of choice here?</b></small></p>
						<p class="fragment"><small>2. <b style="color: yellow;">Is materialism compatible with psychoanalysis?</b> How might an analysis of D/G’s eco/geo/natural metaphors shift in a more overtly psychoanalytical (rather than Marxian) analysis? How effectively (if indeed at all!) does ATP mediate these approaches?</small></p>
