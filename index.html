<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>This site isn't entirely done yet. Or really, it's not even <em>mostly</em> done yet. But you're still welcome to poke around. Eventually there will be slide presentations here! Just not right now.</p>
<p>Here's a list of presentations currently on this site:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="2017/sigcis">“Roomba in Revolt: Sociability and Securitization in the Internet of Things,” a talk I gave at SIGCIS 2017.</a></li>
	<li><a href="2017/rcade">“Vapor Ware, or the Odors of 3D Printing,” given at the 2017 R-CADE Symposium on a panel called “Critical Unmaking.”</a></li>
	<li><a href="2018/mla2018">“Take Only Data, Leave No Footprints,” a talk I gave at MLA 2018 on the speculative work of cybersecurity.</a></li>
