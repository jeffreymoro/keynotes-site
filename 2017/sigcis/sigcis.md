<p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: left;">“I am a home automation nut. When I arrive home my lights turn on. In lieu of motion detecting lights, I have a Z-wave motion detector that notifies my Revolv when there is motion on any side of our home and turns on the appropriate lights. <span class="fragment highlight-green">Although I do set a home alarm, there is really no more effective vacation security than the programatic turning on, dimming, and turning off of lights in a manner that would indicate that people are home.</span> After buying my Revolv I put my outdoor landscaping light on it and threw away the old timer. Now at Sunset my landscape lighting turns on. Holiday lighting does the same. <span class="fragment highlight-green">It’s magical.</span>” <br/> — Arlo Gilbert, [“The time that Tony Fadell sold me a container of hummus.”](https://arlogilbert.com/the-time-that-tony-fadell-sold-me-a-container-of-hummus-cb0941c762c1#.3m7fy21vx)</p>
